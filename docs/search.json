      "contents": "\r\n\r\nHow did we meet?\r\nJ: We sat down next to each other in our English literature class the first semester of college. We’ve been stuck together since. Leslie still proofreads my emails and essays!\r\nL: I walked up to Jina and went “How you doin’?”\r\n\r\nHow did the proposal go down?\r\nJ: I came to Pittsburgh to visit Leslie and we had a game night at our friend Monique’s apartment. It was a Pokemon-themed game night and there was even a Pokemon-version Monopoly board! We played for a while and when it became my turn, I landed on the Chance spot. I went to draw a card but instead, Leslie picked one for me. It was a Pokémon card that said, “Will you marry me? If you say yes, then you will gain a player two forever.”\r\nL: We played board games.\r\n\r\nWho asked whom out first?\r\nJ: For the record, I asked Leslie out first.\r\nL: See Leslie’s response to question #1.\r\n\r\nWhat is our favorite trait about the other person?\r\nJ: He makes me feel loved and secure.\r\nL: She feels like home.\r\n\r\nName one quirky trait/memory about each other.\r\nJ: I have so many I could list off for Leslie. He might not look like it, but Leslie loves all things that are cute, especially animals. We went to a destination wedding last year and he spent most of the time petting and feeding the stray cats and dogs. We also traveled to Japan recently and he brought a bag of cat food so he could feed any stray cats.\r\nL: Jina learned Glare. It’s super effective!\r\n\r\nWhat is our favorite Pokémon?\r\nJ: Too many to pick, but definitely between Eevee, Riolu, or Latios.\r\nL: Squirtle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
